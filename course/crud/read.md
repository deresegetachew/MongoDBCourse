# Query Documents

Queries are made up 2 operations

- Querying Operation (criteria's defining  what we want fetched from the database)
- Projection Operation (selecting what we want as a response)

Syntax :

```
    db.collection.find({<query operations>},{<projection operation>})
```

Lets look at the different operators used to build this two operations
