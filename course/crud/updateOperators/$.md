# $

```js
    { "<array>.$" : value }
```

The positional $ operator identifies an element in an array to update without explicitly specifying the position of the element in the array.

When used with update operations, e.g. ```db.collection.update()``` and ```db.collection.findAndModify()```,

- the positional `$` operator acts as a placeholder for the first element that matches the query document, and
- **the array field must appear as part of the query document**.

```js
db.collection.update(
   { <array>: value ... },
   { <update operator>: { "<array>.$" : value } }
)
```

- Do not use the positional operator `$` with upsert operations because inserts will use the `$` as a field name in the inserted document.

- The positional `$` operator cannot be used for queries which traverse more than one array, such as queries that traverse arrays nested within other arrays, because the replacement for the `$` placeholder is a single value

- When used with the `$unset` operator, the positional `$` operator does not remove the matching element from the array but rather sets it to null.

- If the query matches the array using a negation operator, such as `$ne`, `$not`, or `$nin`, then you cannot use the positional operator to update values from this array.

- However, if the negated portion of the query is inside of an $elemMatch expression, then you can use the positional operator to update this field.
