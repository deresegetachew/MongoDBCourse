# $[]

Syntax

```js
{ <update operator>: { "<array>.$[]" : value } }
```

The all positional operator `$[]` indicates that the update operator should modify all elements in the specified array field.

- If an upsert operation results in an insert, the query must include an exact equality match on the array field in order to use the `$[]` positional operator in the update statement. <br>

- If the upsert operation did not include an exact equality match and no matching documents were found to update, the upsert operation would error.

- The `$[]` positional operator facilitates updates to arrays that contain embedded documents. To access the fields in the embedded documents, use the dot notation on the `$[]` operator.

```js
    db.students.insertMany([
        {
            name:'john',
            age:5,
            grade: 3,
            score: [{maths: 80},{english: 45},{history: 67}]

        },
        {
            name:'angela',
            age:8,
            grade: 4,
            score:  [{maths: 30},{english: 75},{history: 57}]
        },

        {

             score:  [{maths: 70},{english: 95},{history: 87},{maths:'80'},{english:78}]
        }

Lets try a different kind of data set

```js
    db.students.insertMany([
        {
            name:'john',
            age:5,
            grade: 3,
            score: [{maths: 40 , english: 50, history: 67},{math: 60,english: 55, history: 70}]

        },
        {
            name:'angela',
            age:8,
            grade: 4,
             score: [{maths: 90 , english: 70, history: 57},{math: 30,english: 45, history: 70}]
        },

        {
            name:'donald',
            age:12,
            grade: 7,

        }
    ])
